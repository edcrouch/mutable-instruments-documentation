## Revisions

### v1.1 (released 20/05/17)

* Fixed a rarely occurring bug causing the 808 HH model to produce a distorted noise when the module is powered on.
* Added more filtering/hysteresis to the potentiometers, so that the hidden sequencer mode produces voltages stable enough for controlling a quantizer or oscillator.
* Fixed a bug causing the tap tempo LFO to skip pulses when similar patterns are sent to both inputs (with less than 21Âµs of difference between their edges).
* The code has, overall more "headroom" in terms of CPU usage, and provides a more stable basis for the development of alternative firmware.

### v1.0

Initial release.
