## Easter egg

The following button press sequence must be performed four times: 

* Short press on channel 1's function selector (**E**).
* Short press on channel 2's function selector.
* Long press on channel 1's function selector.
* Long press on channel 2's function selector.

The module turns into a generator of chaotic signals ([Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)).

* **SHAPE**: rate (time step value), also CV-controlled by the **EXCITE** input.
* **AMOUNT**: routing of the random signal to amplitude or cutoff. This can either affect an external signal patched to the **IN** input, or when this input is left unpatched, the random signal is directly generated on the output.
