## Features

### The cornerstones of modular patches

VCAs are absolutely essential in a modular system, for example for:

* Shaping the amplitude or timbre of a tone with an envelope.
* Animating a mixture of several oscillators.
* Controlling the amount of filter modulation with a random source or a touch controller.
* Applying an envelope on the linear FM signal hitting an oscillator.

### An updated classic

* More compact footprint (10-HP), with sliders instead of knobs for the main gain/CV control.
* Gain indicator LED.
* Positive offset control (0 to 8V) for direct use of bipolar modulation sources.

### Specifications

* All inputs DC-coupled.
* All inputs handle audio-rate signals.
* Input impedance: 100k for all inputs.
* Gain scale: a +5V CV translates to a gain of 1 (0dB), both in linear and in exponential mode.
* Large gains above +20dB (sufficient for amplifying line-level signals) achievable in exponential mode.
* Offset control adding an adjustable voltage from 0 to 8V to the gain CV.
