## Alternate mode

Move the **FRAME** knob to its minimum position and repeatedly press the **DEL** button (10 times). The module will provide an entirely different way of controlling the gains/CV levels on the 4 channels, inspired by quadrature oscillators. The same "secret handshake" can be used to exit this special mode and reset the module to standard operation.

To explore this mode, we recommend you to enable the **OFFSET**, leave all inputs unconnected, and patch the 4 channel outputs to the CV inputs of oscillators or filters...

The **FRAME** knob - along with the **FRAME** input and its attenuverter - control the main frequency.

The channel 1 knob controls the waveform - read from a wavetable, with interpolation.

The channel 2 knob controls the difference in wavetable position between each channel. In its default position, at 12 o'clock, all channels play the same waveform. Turn it clockwise or counter-clockwise to cause each channel to read a different waveform from the wavetable.

The channel 3 knob controls the phase or frequency offset between each channel. In its default position, at 12 o'clock, all channels are locked in phase and in frequency. Turn it clockwise to create a phase-shift between channels (until quadrature oscillation is reached); and turn it counter-clockwise to create a frequency shift between channels.

Finally, the channel 4 knob controls a kind of phase-modulation "bleed" between each channel. In its default position, at 12 o'clock, all channels are independent. Turn it clockwise and each channel will be increasingly modulated by the next channel. Turn it counter-clockwise and each channel will be increasingly modulated by the previous channel.
