## Features

### Audio buffer acquisition

* Stereo I/O. Even with a mono recording buffer, a wide stereo output can still be simulated by randomly panning grains or through the stereo reverberator.
* Stereo pre-amp with a gain range covering modular and line levels.
* Recording buffer size: 1s (32kHz, stereo) to 8s (16kHz, µ-law, mono).
* The **FREEZE** button and the corresponding gate input freezes the content of the recording buffer, allowing you to dive into its sonic details.
* 4 memory slots for storing and recalling buffers.

### Granular synthesis

* Grain generation time base: periodical, randomized, or externally clocked.
* The **POSITION** knob selects from which part of the recording buffer the grains are extracted.
* Grain size from 16ms to 1s.
* Up to 40 to 60 concurrent grains (depending on recording buffer resolution).
* Transposition from -2 octaves to +2 octaves, with V/O tracking.
* Grain envelope continuously variable between boxcar, triangle and Hann functions.
* CV inputs for all grain parameters, individually sampled and held by each grain. For stochastic, Xenakis-style explorations, try feeding random voltages to those!
* Diffusion network with 4 All-pass filters to post process the granularized signals.

### Post-processing ("blending") settings

4 post-processing parameters are controlled by the **BLEND** knob and CV input:

* Dry/wet balance.
* Random panning amount.
* Feedback amount.
* Reverb amount.

### Specifications

* Input impedances: 100k.
* Audio input gain range: line level to modular level.
* CV range: +/- 5V. CVs outside of this range are simply clipped.
* Internal processing: 32kHz, 32-bit floating point. RAM Recording buffer uses 16-bit (high quality) or 8-bit µ-law (low quality) resolution.

## Revisions and variants

### 2015

Hardware revision labelled "v3" with the following differences:

* Metal-shaft **IN GAIN** potentiometer (originally, plastic shaft, with a wobbly feel since it was not fastened to the panel). This potentiometer is hand-soldered, since it can become very scratchy when exposed to the heat of a regular wave-soldering process.
* TL072 op-amp for the audio input and output (originally LME49720, a large stock of which had been bought for other projects).
* External 12.288 MHz crystal for clocking the codec (originally: the MCU generates the codec's master clock).
