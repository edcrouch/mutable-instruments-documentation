## v1.1 aka "Ringified Elements"

This update adds two new alternative synthesis models for the resonator section. To activate them, set the 8 knobs and 5 attenuverters of Elements' resonator section fully CW (mnemonic: Resonator to the max!), and hold the **PLAY** button for 5s. The blinking pattern of the **PLAY** button will indicate which model is active. You can repeat the procedure to cycle through the three models:

* 1 blink: Original resonator (modal filter bank).
* 2 blinks: Non-linear string model. The resonator is a comb filter, and **GEOMETRY** controls the amount of three types of non-linearity in the feedback loop.
* 3 blinks: Chords. With this model, the resonator is a bank of 6 comb filters, tuned to the different notes of a chord. **GEOMETRY** selects the chord type.

## v1.0

Initial release. **Note:** Elements was designed to be a **one knob per function**, **no secret state** module. For this reason, this version of the firmware has always been programmed on all modules, even the most recent.
