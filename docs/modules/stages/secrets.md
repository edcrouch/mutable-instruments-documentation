## Easter egg

**Ouroboros**, an additive synthesis oscillator with 6 partials.

Use the chaining cable to link the module to itself.

The first channel sets the fundamental frequency: slider for coarse tuning, pot for fine-tuning. The **CV** input will track **V/O**.

For the remaining channels, the slider and **CV** input set the amplitude of the harmonic, and the pot adjusts its frequency ratio.

Output 1 contains all harmonics mixed and enveloped, outputs 2-6 contain each individual harmonics.

The **GATE** inputs can be used to "ping" an individual harmonic.

Finally, the segment type buttons cycle through different waveforms:

* **Green**: sine
* **Orange**: triangle
* **Red**: square
* **Green** blinking: saw
* **Orange** blinking: 25% pulse
* **Red** blinking: 10% pulse
