## Features

### Synthesis models

#### The classics

* CS-80 style sawtooth with a notch.
* Continuously variable morphing between triangle, sawtooth, square and pulse, with character control.
* Square/sawtooth with pulse width control.
* Triangle to sine morphing, with wavefolder.

#### Direct digital synthesis

* Band-limited dual pulse train, with detuning.
* Dual square or sawtooth oscillator with hard sync.
* Triple saw, square, triangle or sine.
* Stack of three ring-modulated sine waves.
* Swarm of seven sawtooth waves.
* Comb-filtered sawtooth wave
* Circuit-bent sawtooth generator with sample rate reduction and bit toggling.
* Direct synthesis of filtered waveforms, casio CZ style.
* Low-fi or hi-fi vowel/formant synthesis.
* Harmonic oscillator.
* FM with various feedback paths.

#### Physical and percussive models

* Plucked string (Karplus Strong).
* Bowed string.
* Reed and flute.
* Bell and metallic drum.
* 808 bass drum, cymbal noise and snare drum.

#### Wavetables

* 256 waveforms, organized as 21 wavetables or as a 16x16 XY map.
* 4-note chord synthesis.

#### Noise sources

* Noise processed by a tuned multimode filter.
* Noise processed by a dual BP filter.
* Clocked digital noise.
* Cloud of sinusoidal grains.
* Particle synthesis.

### Additional settings

These settings are accessible through a menu, and are not CV controllable.

* Bit-depth (from 4 to 16 bits) and sample rate (from 4kHz to 96kHz).
* Quantizer on the CV-input with a large selection of scales.
* Analog VCO-style linear detuning of higher frequencies.
* Analog VCO-style pitch drifting.
* Waveform quirks, unique to each module built.
* Built-in AD envelope, assignable to the oscillator frequency, the **COLOR** and **TIMBRE** parameters, and to the amplitude.
* **META** mode enabling CV-controlled model selection with the **FM** input.

### Specifications

* All inputs: 100k impedance, DC to 4kHz.
* 12-bit CV capture.
* 96kHz, 16-bit audio processing (some algorithms are 2x or 4x oversampled).

## Revisions and variants

### 2015

Hardware revision labelled "v5" with the following differences:

* 2x5 power connector (originally 2x8).
* Built-in 5V regulator.
* **FINE** knob handled in software (originally handled as an offset on the FM signal, not working in **META** mode as a side-effect)
* Thonkiconn jacks.
* Potentiometers have no center detent.
