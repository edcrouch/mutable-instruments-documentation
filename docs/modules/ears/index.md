## Features

### Ears for your modular

* Built-in contact microphone soldered right under the front panel, turning the panel and your entire case into a microphone.
* Increasingly spaced ridges on the panel, generating sonically interesting pulses or impulse combs when rubbed. Strike, pick or scratch digital resonators like Rings, Elements or the 4ms SMR.
* High-quality amplification stage suitable for external contact microphones, electro-acoustic instruments like guitars, or plain line-level signals.

### Extending the Mikrophonie

Compared to the Mikrophonie, Ears has additional outputs:

* Envelope follower, translating the decaying amplitude profile of a tap into an envelope CV.
* Gate detector, translating taps into gate signals.
* Envelope follower and gate detector can process external signals.

### Specifications

* Audio amplifier with 1M input impedance, up to 40dB of gain.
* External input bypassing the built-in contact microphone.
* Envelope follower with 3 preset attack and release times (adjustable by jumper).
* Gate detector with 3 preset sensitivity levels (adjustable by jumper) and +8V gate output.
* Three indicator LEDs: amplifier clipping (red), envelope follower level (white), gate detector activity (orange).

## Revisions and variants

A rare version of the module (30 units) has a different pattern on the panel, meant to be "scratched" with a plectrum.
