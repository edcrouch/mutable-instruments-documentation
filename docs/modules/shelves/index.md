## Features

### Controls

The low-shelf, high-shelf, and parametric sections all share the same control ranges and scales:

* Correction frequency range: 20 Hz to 20kHz.
* Correction frequency CV scale: 1V/Oct.
* Cut/boost range: -15dB to 15dB (knob), -40dB to 15dB (CV).
* Cut/boost CV scale: 3dB/V.
* Parametric correction Q: 0.5 to 20 (up to 1000 with external CV offset).

The global frequency offset and cut/boost CV inputs affect all sections.

### Outputs

The two parametric sections are realized with state-variable filters with individual BP, HP and LP outputs.

### Specifications

* Analog, DC-coupled signal path.
* Input impedance 100k (25k for the global frequency and gain CV inputs).
* All CV inputs handle audio-rate modulations.

## Revisions and variants

### 2015

Hardware revision labelled "v6" which includes six individual outputs derived from the two parametric sections. Originally, they were available on a separate 4HP expander.
