## Features

### Three essential functions

* The 1:3 section is a buffered multiple, allowing a note CV to be distributed to up to 3 VCOs without voltage drop.
* The 2:2 section is a 2-input summer with unity gains (also known as a precision adder). The sum of the two input channels is distributed to 2 outputs.
* The 3:1 section is a 3-input mixer, with a gain of 1/3 per channel (also known as an averager). It is particularly suitable for rapidly mixing audio sources such as oscillators, for which a unity gain mixer would have caused clipping.

### Specifications

* Input impedance: 1M for the buffered multiple, 100k for the mixers.
* Buffered multiple with low offset error.
* 0.1% resistors, allowing the 2:2 section to work as a precision adder.
* All inputs DC-coupled.
* Audio-rate signals accepted.

## Revisions and variants

Following an initial batch of 250 modules manufactured by PCBCart in China, the production of Links moved to France where every other module was being made.

### 2015

Hardware revision labelled "v4" with the following differences:

* Green PCB.
* Thonkiconn jacks.
* SMT Components soldered on the same side as the jacks (not exposed on the back of the module).
