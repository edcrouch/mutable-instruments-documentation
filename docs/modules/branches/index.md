## Features

### Liven up your patches

* Randomly skip steps in a sequence, triggers in a rhythmic pattern.
* Dispatch rhythmic events to two instruments or sub-patches.
* A building block for large generative patches.
* An abrasive digital noise source at audio rates!

### Specifications

* Gate inputs: 100k impedance, 0.6V threshold.
* CV inputs: 100k impedance, +/- 5V.
* Outputs: +5V for the HIGH level.
* Response time: 15Âµs.

## Revisions and variants

An initial batch of 250 units was made by a dubious CM in the US, only a small fraction of which has been sold. The next batches were made in France at the end of 2014.

### 2014

Hardware revision labelled "v4" with the following differences:

* Green PCB.
* Thonkiconn jacks.
